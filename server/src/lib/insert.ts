Someone a few feet away threatening to harm or kill you at any moment is assault. Intimidation is less severe as there’s a distance that someone can escape through, or that the perpetrator has more time to reconsider the threat.

Its range in imprisonment is intended to account for when such severe harm is premeditated or accidental.For accidents and negligence there must be evidence of foul play, criminality in the instance, or some other factor beyond a truly accidental incident. For example, injuring someone while speeding or intoxicated.\n\n((Aggravated Battery is much less severe and would not, for example, leave someone in a coma or brutally wounded script-wise.

An opportunity to reflect (and therefore possibly change your mind) demonstrates premeditation and is murder. Manslaughter is only charged in the penal code when some sort of criminal negligence or action can be proven. Killing someone while driving drunk is manslaughter.

Manslaughter happens in a heat of passion, by criminal negligence or accident, or for some other incident that is not expected. The only exception to this is when someone commits a planned felony, such as planning to commit an arson.

Mayhem can be added to any change in an instance where the Mayhem took place while, or along with, the crime being committed. It is not automatically applied to charges that may be considered Mayhem (such as an Arson that leads to Murder) unless there is the demonstration of the perpetrator torturing someone specifically in that act of Arson.

It is up to the Fire Marshal’s Office and investigating Law Enforcement Agency jointly to prove an arson was malicious and therefore criminal. Negligence or accident can be included if it is proven criminal in nature."),

This falls under Officer Discretion.\n\n NOTES: Trespassing refers to anyone who is told to leave and refuses to do so, but lacks any intention of committing a crime or other malice aforethought or action. Burglary is a far more severe act of trespassing as it comes with evidence of criminal intent.\n\n If police close down a public space it is trespassing to enter that public space without their authorization. The same applies if a typically public space is temporarily closed.\n\nOwners of trailers or caravans may only consider their trailer or caravan their own property.
